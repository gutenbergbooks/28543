<p><span class="smcap">My dear son:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The doctors have left and I am
told that in a few hours I shall
die. In my lifetime the world has
progressed from the chaotic turmoil
of the early Atomic era to
the peacefulness and tranquility
of our present age, and I die
content.</p>

<p>For ten years I have instructed
you in all that you will need for
the future. One final lesson remains
to be taught.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the wall of my bedchamber
hangs a citation "from a grateful
government for services too
secret to be herein set forth."
In past years you have asked me
repeatedly about this citation, but
each time I have taken pains to
avoid a direct answer. Now it is
proper that you should know.</p>

<p>Forty years ago I was an obscure
Army captain stationed at
the Armed Forces Language
School in Monterey, California.
I had at that time just completed
a tour of duty in Korea, a minor
skirmish of that era, and despite
an excellent reputation for resourcefulness,
I had drawn Monterey
as my next assignment. An
aptitude for foreign languages
had led to an instructorship in
the Russian department with additional
duties instructing in the
Slavic tongues.</p>

<p>My life was pleasant and uneventful,
and it was with mixed
emotions that I received orders
to report to Washington for a new
duty assignment. The chain of
events which precipitated those
orders were to change the
world....</p>

<p>For while you and I were playing
on the lawn of our Monterey
home, an unknown Hungarian
physicist working under Russian
supervision had made a startling
discovery. Within a matter of
days alarming rumors of his work
reached Washington. Our embassies
in Moscow and Belgrade
reported furious activity in the
field of psychic research and
large-scale experiments in mass
hypnosis. Four of us were selected
to investigate the rumors.
Before we could commence our
undertaking, word reached Washington
that the rumors were now
actualities. A device capable of
the mass hypnosis of great segments
of the world's population
was rapidly reaching perfection.</p>

<p>After three months of intensive
grooming in the fields of physics
and psychology, we four agents
set out individually with orders
to track down and destroy both
the scientist and his machine. I
never saw the other three
again....</p>

<p>During the three months of
schooling, other members of our
vast intelligence organization had
been engaged in laying the
groundwork for our efforts. In
December 1955, I slipped into
Russia and took the place of a
government official who felt
that Western civilization offered
greater reimbursement than Soviet
Communism.</p>

<p>I entered into my new role
with trepidation, but my fears
were unfounded. Thanks to a remarkable
resemblance (which
was the original reason for my selection)
and also due to a most
thorough briefing, I found myself
making the substitution with ease.
I pride myself on the fact that
by diligent application I was able
to increase my worth to the
Russian government to the extent
that I was shortly able to
secure my transfer to the psychological
warfare section of the
secret police. From there it was
a simple procedure to have myself
assigned to what was known as
"Project Parchak."</p>

<p>The device was in its final
stage of development; only the
problem of increasing its effective
range remained to be solved.
Three weeks after my assignment
to the project, its successful conclusion
was accomplished.</p>

<p>In June 1956, the Russian
government ordered me to a
small house on the outskirts of
Braila, Hungary, where I was to
attend a private showing of the
device. By design, I arrived one
day early and made my way to
the laboratory immediately. Dr.
Michael Parchak, the inventor,
stood facing me as I entered. On
a table between us lay a small
complicated mechanism resembling
a radio transmitter. But it
was infinitely more than that.
The device was a thought generator
capable of hypnotizing
every thinking creature on the
face of the earth. The power of
infinite goodness or evil which
the machine embodied was terrifying
to consider.</p>

<p>I listened to Parchak's boasting
with revulsion. Although he
had the ability to work for the
ultimate good of mankind, this
creature intended, instead, to use
his newly found power for selfish
aggrandizement.</p>

<p>I drew him out, let him explain
the inner workings of his
device&mdash;and killed him. My orders
were to destroy the machine.
I disobeyed them. Utilizing the
machine to make good my escape,
I left Hungary and returned to
the United States. The citation
which you have seen was only one
of the many honors which were
bestowed upon me.</p>

<p>A few weeks later I resigned
my commission and retired to a
country hideaway to experiment
further with the device I was
supposed to have destroyed. The
peace and tranquility in which
we of the earth now live marked
the successful culmination of my
experiments.</p>

<p>You will find the machine
walled up in the North alcove
of my bedchamber.</p>

<p>Your education is now complete
my son, use it well. Be
kind to our slave peoples, the
world is yours.</p>

<p>Your affectionate father,</p>

<p class="pr2">FRANCIS I<br />
EMPEROR OF THE EARTH</p>
